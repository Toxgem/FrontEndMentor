## My process

I played around with grid for some hours, because everything was messy but i was resolve to use it somehow, I like to use rem and em as they actually escalate better with responsivness, but  still used some fixed px units for mobile devices, went for a mobile aproach first and then use some query for desktop sizes, as this is the trend way to do.




### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Basic CSS 
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

The using of extensions for the sake of trying out different screen sizes at the same time, i played with some grid, i am not really into it but, It was fun somehow to try and make it responsive that way
